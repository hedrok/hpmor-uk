// 411
//__Some __children would have waited until __after__ their first trip
//to Diagon Alley.
__Деякі__ діти зачекали б, доки їхнє перше відвідування алеї Діаґон
__завершиться__.

// 412
//“Bag of element 79,” Harry said, and withdrew his hand, empty, from the
//mokeskin pouch.
-- Мішечок з елементом 79, -- сказав Гаррі, і висунув руку, порожню, з мокового
капшучка.

// 413
//Most children would have at least waited to get their __wands__ first.
Більшість дітей принаймні зачекали, доки не отримають спочатку свої __чарівні
палички__.

// 414
//“Bag of __okane,__” said Harry. The heavy bag of gold popped up into his
//hand.
-- Мішечок з __окане__, -- сказав Гаррі. Важкий мішечок золота вистрибнув до
його руки.

// 415
//Harry withdrew the bag, then plunged it again into the mokeskin pouch. He took
//out his hand, put it back in, and said, “Bag of tokens of economic exchange.”
//That time his hand came out empty.
Гаррі дістав мішечок, потім знову занурив його до мокового капшучка. Він дістав
руку, занурив її знову, і сказав:

-- Мішечок елементів для економічного обміну, -- цього разу рука повернулася
порожньою.

// 416
//“Give me back the bag that I just put in.” Out came the bag of gold once more.
-- Віддай назад мішечок, що я щойно поклав, -- і ось він мішечок золота.

// 417
//Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres had gotten his hands on at least one magical
//item. Why wait?
Гаррі Джеймс Поттер-Еванс-Веррес отримав до своїх рук вже один магічний предмет.
Навіщо чекати?

// 418
//“Professor McGonagall,” Harry said to the bemused witch strolling beside him,
//“can you give me two words, one word for gold, and one word for something else
//that isn’t money, in a language that I wouldn’t know? But don’t tell me which
//is which.”
-- Професорко Макґонеґел, -- сказав Гаррі спантеличеній відьмі, що йшла поряд,
-- можете сказати мені два слова, щоб одне означало золото, а друге щось інше і
не гроші, мовою, яку я не знаю? Проте не кажіть мені, яке з них що означає.

// 419
//“__Ahava__ and __zahav,__” said Professor McGonagall. “That’s Hebrew,
//and the other word means love.”
// @ Раптом хтось знає, як ці слова вимовляються, чи знає, кохання чи любов,
// скажіть, будь ласка.
-- __Агава__ і __загав__, -- сказала професорка Макґонеґел. -- Це іврит,
інше слово означає любов.

// 420
//“Thank you, Professor. Bag of __ahava.__” Empty.
-- Дякую, професорко. Мішечок з __агава__, -- нічого.

// 421
//“Bag of __zahav.__” And it popped up into his hand.
-- Мішечок з __загав__, -- і той стрибнув до його руки.

// 422
//“Zahav is gold?” Harry questioned, and Professor McGonagall nodded.
-- Загав означає золото? -- запитав Гаррі, і професорка Макґонеґел кивнула.

// 423
//Harry thought over his collected experimental data. It was only the most crude
//and preliminary sort of effort, but it was enough to support at least one
//conclusion:
Гаррі обміркував результати дослідів. Це була лише найгрубіша й перша спроба, проте
цього було достатньо щоб дійти принаймні одного висновку:

// 424
//“__Aaaaaaarrrgh this doesn’t make any sense!__”
-- __Ааааааа, це безглуздя!__

// 425
//The witch beside him lifted a lofty eyebrow. “Problems, Mr. Potter?”
Поряд з ним відьма високо піднесла брову.

-- Проблеми, містере Поттер?

// 426
//“I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know that ‘bag of
//115 Galleons’ is okay but not ‘bag of 90 plus 25 Galleons’? It can
//__count__ but it can’t __add?__ It can understand nouns, but not some
//noun phrases that mean the same thing? The person who made this probably didn’t
//speak Japanese and __I__ don’t speak any Hebrew, so it’s not using
//__their__ knowledge, and it’s not using __my __knowledge -” Harry
//waved a hand helplessly. “The rules seem __sorta__ consistent but they
//don’t __mean__ anything! I’m not even going to ask how a __pouch__
//ends up with voice recognition and natural language understanding when the best
//Artificial Intelligence programmers can’t get the fastest supercomputers to do
//it after thirty-five years of hard work,” Harry gasped for breath, “but
//__what__ is going __on?__”
-- Я щойно спростував кожнісіньку гіпотезу, що в мене була! Як його може
влаштовувати `мішечок зі 115 ґалеонами', проте не `мішечок з 90 плюс 25
ґалеонами'? Він вміє __лічити__, проте не вміє __додавати__? Він розуміє
іменники, проте не деякі фрази з іменників, що означають те саме? Людина, що
створила його, напевно не розмовляла японською, а __я__ геть не знаю іврит,
отже він не використовуї ані __їхні__ знання, ані __мої__ знання... -- Гаррі
безпомічно махнув рукою. -- Правила __начебто__ послідовні, проте вони нічого
не __означають__! Я навіть не збираюся питати, як __капшучок__ став обладнаним
розпізнаванням і розумінням природної мови, коли найкращі програмісти штучного
інтелекту не змогли змусити найшвидші суперкомпʼютери зробити таке після
тридцяти пʼяти років важкої праці, -- Гаррі перевів подих, -- то __як__ він
__працює__?

// 427
//“Magic,” said Professor McGonagall.
-- Магія, -- сказала професорка Макґонеґел.

// 428
//“That’s just a __word!__ Even after you tell me that, I can’t make any new
//predictions! It’s exactly like saying ‘phlogiston’ or ‘elan vital’ or
//‘emergence’ or ‘complexity’!”
-- Це лише __слово__! Навіть після того, як ви мені сказали це, я не можу
зробити жодного передбачення! Це все одно що сказати `флогістон' чи `елан
вітал', чи `вихід', чи `складність'!

// 429
//The black-robed witch laughed aloud. “But it __is__ magic, Mr. Potter.”
Відьма у чорній мантії відкрито засміялася.

-- Проте це __дійсно__ магія, містере Поттер.

// 430
//Harry slumped over a little. “With respect, Professor McGonagall, I’m not quite
//sure you understand what I’m trying to do here.”
Гаррі спіткнувся.

-- З усією повагою, професорко Макґонеґел, я не впевнений, що ви розумієте,
чого я тут намагаюся досягти.

// 431
//“With respect, Mr. Potter, I’m quite sure I don’t. Unless - this is just a
//guess, mind - you’re trying to take over the world?”
-- З усією повагою, містере Поттер, я доволі певна, що не розумію. Хіба, але
памʼятайте, це лише здогад, хіба що ви намагаєтеся захопити світ?

// 432
//“No! I mean yes - well, __no!__”
-- Ні! Тобто так -- ну, __ні__!

// 433
//“I think I should perhaps be alarmed that you have trouble answering the
//question.”
-- Гадаю, мені варто бути стривоженою через те, що у вас проблеми з відповіддю
на це запитання.

// 434
//Harry glumly considered the Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence in
//1956. It had been the first conference ever on the topic, the one that had
//coined the phrase “Artificial Intelligence”. They had identified key problems
//such as making computers understand language, learn, and improve themselves.
//They had suggested, in perfect seriousness, that significant advances on these
//problems might be made by ten scientists working together for two months.
Гаррі похмуро згадав дартмутську конференцію зі штучного інтелекту в 1956. Це
була найперша конференція щодо цієї теми, на ній вигадали саму назву ``штучний
інтелект''. Вони визначили головні завдання: щоб компʼютери розуміли мову,
навчалися і самовдосконалювалися. Вони були припускали, цілковито серйозно, що
зможуть досягти істотних успіхів протягом двох місяців силами десяти науковців.

// 435
//__No. Chin up. You’re just __starting__ on the problem of
//unravelling all the secrets of magic. You don’t actually __know__ whether
//it’s going to be too difficult to do in two months.__
__Ні. Вище голову. Ти тільки-но__ взявся __за завдання розгадування всіх
таємниць магії. Ти насправді не__ знаєш__, чи так само складно буде зробити це
протягом двох місяців.__

// 436
//“And you __really__ haven’t heard of other wizards asking these sorts of
//questions or doing this sort of scientific experimenting?” Harry asked again.
//It just seemed so __obvious__ to him.
-- А ви __справді__ ніколи не чули, щоб інші чарівники ставили подібні питання,
чи проводили подібні наукові досліди? -- знову запитав Гаррі. Це просто здавалося
йому настільки __очевидним__.

// 437
//Then again, it’d taken more than two hundred years __after__ the invention
//of the scientific method before any Muggle scientists had thought to
//systematically investigate which sentences a __human four-year-old__ could
//or couldn’t understand. The developmental psychology of linguistics could’ve
//been discovered in the eighteenth century, in principle, but no one had even
//thought to look until the twentieth. So you couldn’t really blame the much
//smaller wizarding world for not investigating the Retrieval Charm.
// @ developmental psychology of linguistics
Але знову ж таки, знадобилося більш ніж двісті років __після__ винаходу
наукового методу для того, щоб бодай комусь з маґлівських вчених спало на думку
систематично дослідити, які речення може розуміти __людська дитина чотирьох
років__. Теоретично, лінгвістичну психологію розвитку могли відкрити ще у
вісімнадцятому сторіччі, проте ніхто просто не подумав про це аж до двадцятого.
Отже насправді не можна було звинувачувати набагато менший чарівний світ за те,
що вони не досліджують закляття отримання.

// 438
//Professor McGonagall pursed her lips, then shrugged. “I’m still not sure what
//you mean by ‘scientific experimenting’, Mr. Potter. As I said, I’ve seen
//Muggleborn students try to get Muggle science to work inside Hogwarts, and
//people invent new Charms and Potions every year.”
Професорка Макґонеґел стисла губи, потім знизала плечима.

-- Я досі не впевнена, що ви маєте на увазі, коли кажете `наукові досліди',
містере Поттер. Як я вже казала, я бачила, як учні маґлівського роду намагалися
зробити, щоб маґлівська наука працювала в Гоґвортсі, і як люди винаходять нові
замовляння й зілля щороку.

// 439
//Harry shook his head. “Technology isn’t the same thing as science at all. And
//trying lots of different ways to do something isn’t the same as experimenting
//to figure out the rules.” There were plenty of people who’d tried to invent
//flying machines by trying out lots of things-with-wings, but only the Wright
//Brothers had built a wind tunnel to measure lift… “Um, how many Muggle-raised
//children __do__ you get at Hogwarts every year?”
Гаррі заперечливо похитав головою.

-- Технологія -- це зовсім не те саме, що наука. І випробовувати купу різних
методів зробити щось -- це не те саме, що експериментувати, щоб зрозуміти
правила, -- багато людей намагалися винайти літальні машини і випробовували
купу штук-з-крилами, проте лише брати Райт побудували аеродинамічну трубу, щоб
виміряти підйомну силу.  -- Ем, а як багато вихованих маґлами дітей __іде__ до
Гоґвортсу щороку?

// 440
//“Perhaps ten or so?”
-- Напевно близько десяти?

// 441
//Harry missed a step and almost tripped over his own feet. “__Ten?__”
Гаррі збився з кроку й ледь не перечепився через власну ногу.

-- __Десять?__

// 442
//The Muggle world had a population of six billion and counting. If you were one
//in a million, there were seven of you in London and a thousand more in China.
//It was inevitable that the Muggle population would produce __some__
//eleven-year-olds who could do calculus - Harry knew he wasn’t the only one.
//He’d met other prodigies in mathematical competitions. In fact he’d been
//thoroughly trounced by competitors who probably spent literally __all
//day__ practising maths problems and who’d __never__ read a science-fiction
//book and who would burn out __completely__ before __puberty__ and
//__never__ amount to __anything__ in their future lives because they’d
//just practised __known__ techniques instead of learning to think
//__creatively__. (Harry was something of a sore loser.)
Маґлівський світ мав шість мільярдів населення, і це число зростало. Якщо ви
один з мільйону, то семеро таких є в Лондоні й ще тисяча у Китаї. Маґлівська
популяція неминуче створювала __якусь кількість__ одинадцятирічних, що знали
вищу математику -- Гаррі знав, що він не єдиний. Він зустрічав інших
вундеркіндів на математичних змаганнях. Насправді його трощили суперники, що
витрачали буквально __весь час__ на розвʼязання математичних задач, і які
__ніколи__ не читали наукової фантастики, і які __повністю__ вигорять ще до
__статевої зрілості__ і __ніколи__ не досягнуть __бодай чогось__, адже вони
тренували лише __вже__ відомі техніки замість того, щоб вчитися, як думати
__винахідливо__. (Гаррі ніколи не вмів програвати.)

// 443
//But… in the wizarding world…
Проте... у чаклунському світі...

// 444
//Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who’d all ended their Muggle educations at
//the age of eleven? And Professor McGonagall might be biased, but she had
//claimed that Hogwarts was the largest and most eminent wizarding school in the
//world… and it only educated up to the age of seventeen.
Десять вихованих маґлами дітей на рік, і всі вони завершували маґлівську освіту
в одинадцять років? Професорка Макґонеґел може бути упереджена, проте вона була
стверджувала, що Гоґвортс є найбільша й найліпша чаклунська школа в світі... І
освіта там завершувалася в сімнадцять років.

// 445
//Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail of how you went about
//turning into a cat. But she seemed to have literally never __heard__ of
//the scientific method. To her it was just Muggle magic. And she didn’t even
//seem __curious__ about what secrets might be hiding behind the natural
//language understanding of the Retrieval Charm.
Професорка Макґонеґел безсумнівно знала до останніх дрібниць як перетворитися
на кішку. Проте, видавалося, вона буквально ніколи __не чула__ про науковий
метод. Для неї це була лише маґлівська магія. І її навіть не __цікавлять__
таємниці розуміння природної мови, що їх може приховувати закляття отримання.

// 446
//That left two possibilities, really.
Відповідно, насправді лишалося лише дві можливості.

// 447
//Possibility one: Magic was so incredibly opaque, convoluted, and impenetrable,
//that even though wizards and witches had tried their best to understand, they’d
//made little or no progress and eventually given up; and Harry would do no
//better.
Можливість перша: магія так неймовірно неясна, заплутана й незбагненна, що хоч
чарівники й відьми були зробили все можливо, щоб зрозуміти, вони не досягли
майже (а то й взагалі) нічого, і зрештою здалися. І Гаррі спіткає та ж доля.

// 448
//__Or__…
__Або__...

// 449
//Harry cracked his knuckles in determination, but they only made a quiet sort of
//clicking sound, rather than echoing ominously off the walls of Diagon Alley.
Гаррі рішуче похрустів пальцями, проте це призвело лише до ледь чутного
клацання замість зловісного відлуння від стін алеї Діаґон.

// 450
//Possibility two: He’d be taking over the world.
Можливість друга: він захопить світ.

// 451
//Eventually. Perhaps not right away.
Врешті-решт. Можливо не зараз.

// 452
//That sort of thing __did__ sometimes take longer than two months. Muggle
//science hadn’t gone to the moon in the first week after Galileo.
Такі речі інколи __дійсно__ вимагали більше ніж два місяці. Маґлівська наука не
дісталася місяця за тиждень після Галілео.

// 453
//But Harry still couldn’t stop the huge smile that was stretching his cheeks so
//wide they were starting to hurt.
Проте Гаррі не міг завадити величезній посмішці розтягнути його щоки так
широко, що вони почали боліти.

// 454
//Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies
//that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting
//about how far ahead they’d been at age ten. But then most adult geniuses never
//amounted to anything either. There were probably a thousand people as
//intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history. Because those
//other geniuses hadn’t gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed
//to achieve greatness. They’d never found an important problem.
Гаррі завжди був боявся стати таким, як ті вундеркінди, що нічого не досягли за
решту свого життя, і лише хизувалися, наскільки попереду вони були в десять
років. Проте й більшість дорослих геніїв нічого не досягли. Напевно існувала
принаймні тисяча не менш інтелектуальних людей, ніж Ейнштейн на кожного
Ейнштейна в історії. Через те, що інші генії не натрапили на те єдине, що
абсолютно необхідне, щоб досягти величі. Вони так і не знайшли важливої задачі.

// 455
//__You’re mine now,__ Harry thought at the walls of Diagon Alley, and all
//the shops and items, and all the shopkeepers and customers; and all the lands
//and people of wizarding Britain, and all the wider wizarding world; and the
//entire greater universe of which Muggle scientists understood so much less than
//they believed. __I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, do now claim this
//territory in the name of Science.__
__Тепер це моє,__ подумав Гаррі про стіни алеї Діаґон, і про крамниці й товари,
і про крамарів і покупців; і про всі землі й усіх людей чаклунської Британії, і
всього ширшого чаклунського світу; і про цілий всесвіт, який маґлівські вчені
розуміли настільки гірше, ніж думали. __Я, Гаррі Джеймс Поттер-Еванс-Веррес,
тепер претендую на цю територію імʼям Науки.__

// 456
//Lightning and thunder completely failed to flash and boom in the cloudless
//skies.
Блискавка й грім зовсім не спромоглися сяйнути й прогриміти в безхмарних
небесах.

// 457
//“What are you smiling about?” inquired Professor McGonagall, warily and
//wearily.
-- Чому ви посміхаєтеся? -- стомлено й обережно запитала професорка Макґонеґел.

// 458
//“I’m wondering if there’s a spell to make lightning flash in the background
//whenever I make an ominous resolution,” explained Harry. He was carefully
//memorising the exact words of his ominous resolution so that future history
//books would get it right.
-- Мені цікаво, чи існує заклинання, щоб блискавка спалахувала на тлі щоразу,
як я роблю зловісні рішення, -- пояснив Гаррі. Він старанно запамʼятовував
точні слова свого зловісного рішення, щоб у майбутніх книжках з історії все
було правильно записано.

// 459
//“I have the distinct feeling that I ought to be doing something about this,”
//sighed Professor McGonagall.
-- У мене виникло виразне відчуття, що я маю щось зробити щодо цього, --
зітхнула професорка Макґонеґел.

// 460
//“Ignore it, it’ll go away. Ooh, shiny!” Harry put his thoughts of world
//conquest temporarily on hold and skipped over to a shop with an open display,
//and Professor McGonagall followed.
-- Не зважайте й воно минеться. У, як блищить! -- Гаррі тимчасово відклав свої
думки завоювання всесвіту й попрямував до крамниці з відкритою вітриною, і
професорка Макґонеґел пішла слідом.

'''

// 461
//Harry had now bought his potions ingredients and cauldron, and, oh, a few more
//things. Items that seemed like good things to carry in Harry’s Bag of Holding
//(aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 with Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm,
//and Widening Lip). Smart, sensible purchases.

// 462
//Harry genuinely didn’t understand why Professor McGonagall was looking so
//__suspicious__.

// 463
//Right now, Harry was in a shop expensive enough to display in the twisting main
//street of Diagon Alley. The shop had an open front with merchandise laid out on
//slanted wooden rows, guarded only by slight grey glows and a young-looking
//salesgirl in a much-shortened version of witch’s robes that exposed her knees
//and elbows.

// 464
//Harry was examining the wizarding equivalent of a first-aid kit, the Emergency
//Healing Pack Plus. There were two self-tightening tourniquets. A syringe of
//what looked like liquid fire, which was supposed to drastically slow
//circulation in a treated area while maintaining oxygenation of the blood for up
//to three minutes, if you needed to prevent a poison from spreading through the
//body. White cloth that could be wrapped over a part of the body to temporarily
//numb pain. Plus any number of other items that Harry totally failed to
//comprehend, like the “Dementor Exposure Treatment”, which looked and smelled
//like ordinary chocolate. Or the “Bafflesnaffle Counter”, which looked like a
//small quivering egg and carried a placard showing how to jam it up someone’s
//nostril.

// 465
//“A definite buy at five Galleons, wouldn’t you agree?” Harry said to Professor
//McGonagall, and the teenage salesgirl hovering nearby nodded eagerly.

// 466
//Harry had expected the Professor to make some sort of approving remark about
//his prudence and preparedness.

// 467
//What he was getting instead could only be described as the Evil Eye.

// 468
//“And just __why__,” Professor McGonagall said with heavy scepticism, “do
//you expect to __need__ a healer’s kit, young man?” (After the unfortunate
//incident at the Potions shop, Professor McGonagall was trying to avoid saying
//“Mr. Potter” while anyone else was nearby.)

// 469
//Harry’s mouth opened and closed. “I don’t __expect__ to need it! It’s just
//in case!”

// 470
//“Just in case of __what?__”

// 471
//Harry’s eyes widened. “You think I’m __planning__ to do something
//dangerous and __that’s__ why I want a medical kit?”

// 472
//A look of grim suspicion and ironic disbelief was the answer.

// 473
//“Great Scott!” said Harry. (This was an expression he’d learned from the mad
//scientist Doc Brown in __Back to the Future__.) “Were you also thinking
//that when I bought the Feather-Falling Potion, the Gillyweed, and the bottle of
//Food and Water Pills?”

// 474
//“Yes.”

// 475
//Harry shook his head in amazement. “Just what sort of plan do you think I have
//__going__, here?”

// 476
//“I don’t know,” Professor McGonagall said darkly, “but it ends either in you
//delivering a ton of silver to Gringotts, or in world domination.”

// 477
//“World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world
//optimisation.”

// 478
//This hilarious joke failed to reassure the witch giving him the Look of Doom.

// 479
//“Wow,” Harry said, as he realised that she was serious. “You really think that.
//You really think I’m planning to do something dangerous.”

// 480
//“Yes.”

// 481
//“Like that’s the __only__ reason anyone would ever buy a first-aid kit?
//Don’t take this the wrong way, Professor McGonagall, but __what sort of
//crazy children are you used to dealing with__?”

// 482
//“Gryffindors,” spat Professor McGonagall, the word carrying a freight of
//bitterness and despair that fell like an eternal curse on all youthful
//enthusiasm and high spirits.

// 483
//“Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall,” Harry said, putting his
//hands sternly on his hips. “I am not going to be in Gryffindor -”

// 484
//At this point the Deputy Headmistress interjected something about how if he
//__was__ she would figure out how to kill a hat, which odd remark Harry let
//pass without comment, though the salesgirl seemed to be having a sudden
//coughing fit.

// 485
//“- I am going to be in Ravenclaw. And if you really think that I’m planning to
//do something dangerous, then, honestly, you don’t understand me __at
//all.__ I don’t __like__ danger, it is __scary.__ I am being
//__prudent__. I am being __cautious__. I am preparing for
//__unforeseen contingencies__. Like my parents used to sing to me:
//__Be prepared! That’s the Boy Scout’s marching song! Be prepared! As
//through life you march along! Don’t be nervous, don’t be flustered, don’t be
//scared - be prepared!__”

// 486
//(Harry’s parents had in fact only ever sung him those __particular__ lines
//of that Tom Lehrer song, and Harry was blissfully unaware of the rest.)

// 487
//Professor McGonagall’s stance had slightly softened - though mostly when Harry
//had said that he was heading for Ravenclaw. “What sort of __contingency__
//do you imagine this kit might prepare you for, __young man?__”

// 488
//“One of my classmates gets bitten by a horrible monster, and as I scrabble
//frantically in my mokeskin pouch for something that could help her, she looks
//at me sadly and with her last breath says, __‘Why weren’t you prepared?’__
//And then she dies, and I know as her eyes close that she won’t ever forgive me
//-”

// 489
//Harry heard the salesgirl gasp, and he looked up to see her staring at him with
//her lips pressed tight. Then the young woman whirled and fled into the deeper
//recesses of the shop.

// 490
//__What…?__

// 491
//Professor McGonagall reached down, and took Harry’s hand in hers, gently but
//firmly, and pulled Harry out of the main street of Diagon Alley, leading him
//into an alleyway between two shops which was paved in dirty bricks and
//dead-ended in a wall of solid black dirt.

// 492
//The tall witch pointed her wand at the main street and spoke,
//__“Quietus__” she said, and a screen of silence descended around them,
//blocking out all the street noises.

// 493
//__What did I do wrong…__

// 494
//Professor McGonagall turned to regard Harry. She didn’t have a full adult
//Wrongdoing Face, but her expression was flat, controlled. “You must remember,
//Mr. Potter,” she said, “that there was a war in this country not ten years ago.
//Everyone has lost someone, and to speak of friends dying in your arms - is not
//done lightly.”

// 495
//“I - I didn’t mean to -” The inference dropped like a falling stone into
//Harry’s exceptionally vivid imagination. He’d talked about someone breathing
//their last breath - and then the salesgirl had run away - and the war had ended
//ten years ago so that girl would have been at most eight or nine years old,
//when, when, “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Harry choked up, and turned away to
//run from the older witch’s gaze but there was a wall of dirt blocking his way
//and he didn’t have his wand yet. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m __sorry!__”

// 496
//There came a heavy sigh from behind him. “I know you are, Mr. Potter.”

// 497
//Harry dared to peek behind him. Professor McGonagall only seemed sad, now. “I’m
//sorry,” Harry said again, feeling wretched. “Did anything like that happen to
//-” and then Harry shut his lips and slapped a hand over his mouth for good
//measure.

// 498
//The older witch’s face grew a little sadder. “You must learn to think before
//you speak, Mr. Potter, or else go through life without many friends. That has
//been the fate of many a Ravenclaw, and I hope it will not be yours.”

// 499
//Harry wanted to just run away. He wanted to pull out a wand and erase the whole
//thing from Professor McGonagall’s memory, be back with her outside the shop
//again, __make it didn’t happen -__

// 500
//“But to answer your question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like __that__ has
//ever happened to me. Certainly I’ve watched a friend breathe their last, once
//or seven times. But not one of them ever cursed me as they died, and I never
//thought that they wouldn’t forgive me. Why would you __say__ such a thing,
//Mr. Potter? Why would you even __think__ it?”

// 501
//“I, I, I,” Harry swallowed. “It’s just that I always try to imagine the worst
//thing that could happen,” and maybe he’d also been joking around a little but
//he would rather have bitten off his own tongue than say that now.

// 502
//“What?” said Professor McGonagall. “But __why?”__

// 503
//“So I can stop it from happening!”

// 504
//“Mr. Potter…” the older witch’s voice trailed off. Then she sighed, and knelt
//down beside him. “Mr. Potter,” she said, gently now, “it’s not your
//responsibility to take care of the students at Hogwarts. It’s mine. I won’t let
//anything bad happen to you or anyone else. Hogwarts is the safest place for
//magical children in all the wizarding world, and Madam Pomfrey has a full
//healer’s office. You won’t need a healer’s kit at all, let alone a five-Galleon
//one.”

// 505
//“But I __do!__” Harry burst out. ”__Nowhere__ is perfectly safe! And
//what if my parents have a heart attack or get in an accident when I go home for
//Christmas - Madam Pomfrey won’t be there, I’ll need a healer’s kit of my own -”

// 506
//“__What__ in Merlin’s name…” Professor McGonagall said. She stood up, and
//looked down at Harry an expression torn between annoyance and concern. “There’s
//no need to think about such terrible things, Mr. Potter!”

// 507
//Harry’s expression twisted up into bitterness, hearing that. “Yes there
//__is!__ If you don’t think, you don’t just get hurt yourself, you end up
//hurting other people!”

// 508
//Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, then closed it. The witch rubbed the
//bridge of her nose, looking thoughtful. “Mr. Potter… if I were to offer to
//listen to you for a while… is there anything you’d like to talk to me about?”

// 509
//“About what?”

// 510
//“About why you’re convinced you must always be on your guard against terrible
//things happening to you.”

// 511
//Harry stared at her in puzzlement. That was a self-evident axiom. “Well…” Harry
//said slowly. He tried to organise his thoughts. How __could__ he explain
//himself to a Professor-witch, when she didn’t even know the basics? “Muggle
//researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared to
//reality. Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or
//they say it’ll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years. For
//example, in one experiment, they asked students for times by which they were
//50// sure, 75// sure, and 99// sure they’d complete their homework, and only 13//,
//19//, and 45// of the students finished by those times. And they found that the
//reason was that when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if
//everything went as well as possible, and another group for their average-case
//estimates if everything went as usual, they got back answers that were
//statistically indistinguishable. See, if you ask someone what they expect in
//the __normal__ case, they visualise what looks like the line of maximum
//probability at each step along the way - everything going according to plan,
//with no surprises. But actually, since more than half the students didn’t
//finish by the time they were 99// sure they’d be done, reality usually delivers
//results a little worse than the ‘worst-case scenario’. It’s called the planning
//fallacy, and the best way to fix it is to ask how long things took the last
//time you tried them. That’s called using the outside view instead of the inside
//view. But when you’re doing something new and can’t do that, you just have to
//be really, really, really pessimistic. Like, so pessimistic that reality
//actually comes out __better__ than you expected around as often and as
//much as it comes out worse. It’s actually __really hard__ to be
//__so__ pessimistic that you stand a decent chance of
//__undershooting__ real life. Like I make this big effort to be gloomy and
//I imagine one of my classmates getting bitten, but what actually happens is
//that the surviving Death Eaters attack the whole school to get at me. But on a
//happier note -”

// 512
//“Stop,” said Professor McGonagall.

// 513
//Harry stopped. He had just been about to point out that at least they knew the
//Dark Lord wouldn’t attack, since he was dead.

// 514
//“I think I might not have made myself clear,” the witch said, her precise
//Scottish voice sounding even more careful. “Did anything happen to __you
//personally__ that frightened you, Mr. Potter?”

// 515
//“What happened to me personally is only anecdotal evidence,” Harry explained.
//“It doesn’t carry the same weight as a replicated, peer-reviewed journal
//article about a controlled study with random assignment, many subjects, large
//effect sizes and strong statistical significance.”

// 516
//Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose, inhaled, and exhaled. “I
//would still like to hear about it,” she said.

// 517
//“Um…” Harry said. He took a deep breath. “There’d been some muggings in our
//neighborhood, and my mother asked me to return a pan she’d borrowed to a
//neighbor two streets away, and I said I didn’t want to because I might get
//mugged, and she said, ‘Harry, don’t say things like that!’ Like thinking about
//it would __make__ it happen, so if I didn’t talk about it, I would be
//safe. I tried to explain why I wasn’t reassured, and she made me carry over the
//pan anyway. I was too young to know how statistically unlikely it was for a
//mugger to target me, but I was old enough to know that not-thinking about
//something doesn’t stop it from happening, so I was really scared.”

// 518
//“Nothing else?” Professor McGonagall said after a pause, when it became clear
//that Harry was done. “There isn’t anything __else__ that happened to you?”

// 519
//“I know it doesn’t __sound__ like much,” Harry defended. “But it was just
//one of those critical life moments, you see? I mean, I __knew__ that not
//thinking about something doesn’t stop it from happening, I __knew__ that,
//but I could see that Mum really thought that way.” Harry stopped, struggling
//with the anger that was starting to rise up again when he thought about it.
//“She __wouldn’t listen__. I tried to tell her, I __begged__ her not
//to send me out, and she __laughed it off__. Everything I said, she treated
//like some sort of big joke…” Harry forced the black rage back down again.
//“That’s when I realised that everyone who was supposed to protect me was
//actually crazy, and that they wouldn’t listen to me no matter how much I begged
//them, and that I couldn’t ever rely on them to get anything right.” Sometimes
//good intentions weren’t enough, sometimes you had to be sane…

// 520
//There was a long silence.

// 521
//Harry took the time to breathe deeply and calm himself down. There was no point
//in getting angry. There was no point in getting angry. __All__ parents
//were like that, __no__ adult would lower themselves far enough to place
//themselves on level ground with a child and listen, his genetic parents would
//have been no different. Sanity was a tiny spark in the night, an
//infinitesimally rare exception to the rule of madness, so there was no point in
//getting angry.

// 522
//Harry didn’t like himself when he was angry.

// 523
//“Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall after a
//while. There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look
//that had appeared on Harry’s own face while experimenting on the pouch, if
//Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that). “I shall have to
//think about this.” She turned towards the alley mouthway, and raised her wand -

// 524
//“Um,” Harry said, “can we go get the healer’s kit now?”

// 525
//The witch paused, and looked back at him steadily. “And if I say no - that it
//is too expensive and you won’t need it - then what?”

// 526
//Harry’s face twisted in bitterness. “Exactly what you’re thinking, Professor
//McGonagall. __Exactly__ what you’re thinking. I conclude you’re another
//crazy adult I can’t talk to, and I start planning how to get my hands on a
//healer’s kit anyway.”

// 527
//“I am your guardian on this trip,” Professor McGonagall said with a tinge of
//danger. “I __will not__ allow you to push me around.”

// 528
//“I understand,” Harry said. He kept the resentment out of his voice, and didn’t
//say any of the other things that came to mind. Professor McGonagall had told
//him to think before he spoke. He probably wouldn’t remember that tomorrow, but
//he could at least remember it for five minutes.

// 529
//The witch’s wand made a slight circle in her hand, and the noises of Diagon
//Alley came back. “All right, young man,” she said. “Let’s go get that healer’s
//kit.”

// 530
//Harry’s jaw dropped in surprise. Then he hurried after her, almost stumbling in
//his sudden rush.

'''

// 531
//The shop was the same as they had left it, recognisable and unrecognisable
//items still laid out on the slanted wooden display, the grey glow still
//protecting and the salesgirl back in her old position. The salesgirl looked up
//as they approached, her face showing surprise.

// 532
//“I’m sorry,” she said as they got closer, and Harry spoke at almost the same
//moment, “I apologise for -”

// 533
//They broke off and looked at each other, and then the salesgirl laughed a
//little. “I didn’t mean to get you in trouble with Professor McGonagall,” she
//said. Her voice lowered conspiratorially. “I hope she wasn’t __too__ awful
//to you.”

// 534
//“__Della!__” said Professor McGonagall, sounding scandalised.

// 535
//“Bag of gold,” Harry said to his pouch, and then looked back up at the
//salesgirl while he counted out five Galleons. “Don’t worry, I understand that
//she’s only awful to me because she loves me.”

// 536
//He counted out five Galleons to the salesgirl while Professor McGonagall was
//spluttering something unimportant. “One Emergency Healing Pack Plus, please.”

// 537
//It was actually sort of unnerving to see how the Widening Lip swallowed the
//briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry couldn’t help wondering what would happen if
//he tried climbing into the mokeskin pouch himself, given that only the person
//who put something in was supposed to be able to take it out again.

// 538
//When the pouch was done… eating… his hard-won purchase, Harry swore he heard a
//small burping sound afterward. That __had__ to have been spelled in on
//purpose. The alternative hypothesis was too horrifying to contemplate… in fact
//Harry couldn’t even __think__ of any alternative hypotheses. Harry looked
//back up at the Professor, as they began walking through Diagon Alley once more.
//“Where to next?”

// 539
//Professor McGonagall pointed toward a shop that looked as if it had been made
//from flesh instead of bricks and covered in fur instead of paint. “Small pets
//are permitted at Hogwarts - you could get an owl to send letters, for example
//-”

// 540
//“Can I pay a Knut or something and __rent__ an owl when I need to send
//mail?”

// 541
//“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall.

// 542
//“Then I think emphatically __no.__”

// 543
//Professor McGonagall nodded, as though ticking off a point. “Might I ask why
//not?”

// 544
//“I had a pet rock once. It died.”

// 545
//“You don’t think you could take care of a pet?”

// 546
//“I __could,__” Harry said, “but I would end up obsessing all day long
//about whether I’d remembered to feed it that day or if it was slowly starving
//in its cage, wondering where its master was and why there wasn’t any food.”

// 547
//“That poor owl,” the older witch said in a soft voice. “Abandoned like that. I
//wonder what it would do.”

// 548
//“Well, I expect it’d get really hungry and start trying to claw its way out of
//the cage or the box or whatever, though it probably wouldn’t have much luck
//with that -” Harry stopped short.

// 549
//The witch went on, still in that soft voice. “And what would happen to it
//afterward?”

// 550
//“Excuse me,” Harry said, and he reached up to take Professor McGonagall by the
//hand, gently but firmly, and steered her into yet another alleyway; after
//ducking so many well-wishers the process had become almost unnoticeably
//routine. “Please cast that silencing spell.”

// 551
//“__Quietus.__”

// 552
//Harry’s voice was shaking. “That owl does __not__ represent me, my parents
//__never__ locked me in a cupboard and left me to starve, I do __not__
//have abandonment fears and I __don’t like the trend of your thoughts,
//Professor McGonagall!__”

// 553
//The witch looked down at him gravely. “And what thoughts would those be, Mr.
//Potter?”

// 554
//“You think I was,” Harry was having trouble saying it, “I was __abused?__”

// 555
//“Were you?”

// 556
//“__No!__” Harry shouted. “No, I never was! Do you think I’m
//__stupid?__ I __know__ about the concept of child abuse, I
//__know__ about inappropriate touching and all of that and if anything like
//that happened I would call the police! And report it to the head teacher! And
//look up social services in the phone book! And tell Grandpa and Grandma and
//Mrs. Figg! But my parents __never__ did anything like that, never ever
//__ever!__ How __dare__ you suggest such a thing!”

// 557
//The older witch gazed at him steadily. “It is my duty as Deputy Headmistress to
//investigate possible signs of abuse in the children under my care.”

// 558
//Harry’s anger was spiralling out of control into pure, black fury. “Don’t you
//ever __dare__ breathe a word of these, these __insinuations__ to
//anyone else! __No one__, do you hear me, McGonagall? An accusation like
//that can ruin people and destroy families even when the parents are completely
//innocent! I’ve read about it in the newspapers!” Harry’s voice was climbing to
//a high-pitched scream. “The __system__ doesn’t know how to __stop__,
//it doesn’t believe the parents __or__ the children when they say nothing
//happened! __Don’t you dare threaten my family with that! I won’t let you
//destroy my home!__”

// 559
//“Harry,” the older witch said softly, and she reached out a hand towards him -

// 560
//Harry took a fast step back, and his hand snapped up and knocked hers away.

// 561
//McGonagall froze, then she pulled her hand back, and took a step backwards.
//“Harry, it’s all right,” she said. “I believe you.”

// 562
//“__Do you,__” Harry hissed. The fury still roaring through his blood. “Or
//are you just waiting to get away from me so you can file the papers?”

// 563
//“Harry, I saw your house. I saw you with your parents. They love you. You love
//them. I do believe you when you say that your parents are not abusing you. But
//I __had__ to ask, because there is something strange at work here.”

// 564
//Harry stared at her coldly. “Like what?”

// 565
//“Harry, I’ve seen many abused children in my time at Hogwarts, it would break
//your heart to know how many. And, when you’re happy, you don’t behave like one
//of those children, not at __all__. You smile at strangers, you hug people,
//I put my hand on your shoulder and you didn’t flinch. But sometimes, only
//sometimes, you say or do something that seems __very__ much like… someone
//who spent his first eleven years locked in a cellar. Not the loving family that
//I saw.” Professor McGonagall tilted her head, her expression growing puzzled
//again.

// 566
//Harry took this in, processing it. The black rage began to drain away, as it
//dawned on him that he was being listened to respectfully, and that his family
//wasn’t in danger.

// 567
//“And how __do__ you explain your observations, Professor McGonagall?”

// 568
//“I don’t know,” she said. “But it’s possible that something could have happened
//to you that you don’t remember.”

// 569
//Fury rose up again in Harry. That sounded all too much like what he’d read in
//the newspaper stories of shattered families. “Suppressed memory is a load of
//__pseudoscience!__ People do __not__ repress traumatic memories, they
//remember them all __too__ well for the rest of their lives!”

// 570
//“No, Mr. Potter. There is a Charm called Obliviation.”

// 571
//Harry froze in place. “A spell that erases memories?”

// 572
//The older witch nodded. “But not all the effects of the experience, if you see
//what I’m saying, Mr. Potter.”

// 573
//A chill went down Harry’s spine. __That__ hypothesis… could __not__
//be easily refuted. “But my parents couldn’t do that!”

// 574
//“Indeed not,” said Professor McGonagall. “It would have taken someone from the
//wizarding world. There’s… no way to be certain, I’m afraid.”

// 575
//Harry’s rationalist skills began to boot up again. “Professor McGonagall, how
//sure are you of your observations, and what alternative explanations could
//there also be?”

// 576
//The witch opened her hands, as though to show their emptiness. “Sure? I’m sure
//of __nothing__, Mr. Potter. In all my life I’ve never met anyone else like
//you. Sometimes you just don’t seem eleven years old or even all that
//__human__.”

// 577
//Harry’s eyebrows rose toward the sky -

// 578
//“I’m sorry!” Professor McGonagall said quickly. “I’m very sorry, Mr. Potter. I
//was trying to make a point and I’m afraid that came out sounding different from
//what I had in mind -”

// 579
//“On the contrary, Professor McGonagall,” Harry said, and slowly smiled. “I
//shall take it as a very great compliment. But would you mind if I offered an
//alternative explanation?”

// 580
//“Please do.”

// 581
//“Children aren’t meant to be too much smarter than their parents,” Harry said.
//“Or too much saner, maybe - my father could probably outsmart me if he was, you
//know, actually __trying,__ instead of using his adult intelligence mainly
//to come up with new reasons not to change his mind -” Harry stopped. “I’m too
//smart, Professor. I’ve got nothing to say to normal children. Adults don’t
//respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if they did, they
//wouldn’t sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as well read something
//Richard Feynman wrote instead. I’m __isolated__, Professor McGonagall.
//I’ve been isolated my whole life. Maybe that has some of the same effects as
//being locked in a cellar. And I’m too intelligent to look up to my parents the
//way that children are designed to do. My parents love me, but they don’t feel
//obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like they’re the children -
//children who __won’t listen__ and have absolute authority over my whole
//existence. I try not to be too bitter about it, but I also try to be
//__honest__ with myself, so, yes, I’m bitter. And I also have an anger
//management problem, but I’m working on it. That’s all.”

// 582
//“__That’s all?__”

// 583
//Harry nodded firmly. “That’s all. Surely, Professor McGonagall, even in magical
//Britain, the normal explanation is always worth __considering?__”

'''

// 584
//It was later in the day, the sun lowering in the summer sky and shoppers
//beginning to peter out from the streets. Some shops had already closed; Harry
//and Professor McGonagall had bought his textbooks from Flourish and Blotts just
//under the deadline. With only a slight explosion when Harry had made a beeline
//for the keyword “Arithmancy” and discovered that the seventh-year textbooks
//invoked nothing more mathematically advanced than trigonometry.

// 585
//At this moment, though, dreams of low-hanging research fruit were far from
//Harry’s mind.

// 586
//At this moment, the two of them were walking out of Ollivander’s, and Harry was
//staring at his wand. He’d waved it, and produced multicoloured sparks, which
//really shouldn’t have come as such an extra shock after everything else he’d
//seen, but somehow -

// 587
//__I can do magic.__

// 588
//__Me. As in, me personally. I am magical; I am a wizard.__

// 589
//He had __felt__ the magic pouring up his arm, and in that instant,
//realised that he had always had that sense, that he had possessed it his whole
//life, the sense that was not sight or sound or smell or taste or touch but only
//magic. Like having eyes but keeping them always closed, so that you didn’t even
//realise that you were seeing darkness; and then one day the eye opened, and saw
//the world. The shock of it had poured through him, touching pieces of himself,
//awakening them, and then died away in seconds; leaving only the certain
//knowledge that he was now a wizard, and always had been, and had even, in some
//strange way, always known it.

// 590
//And -

// 591
//__“It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand
//when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.”__

// 592
//That could not __possibly__ be coincidence. There had been
//__thousands__ of wands in that shop. Well, okay, actually it
//__could__ be coincidence, there were six billion people in the world and
//thousand-to-one coincidences happened every day. But Bayes’s Theorem said that
//any reasonable hypothesis which made it __more__ likely than a
//thousand-to-one that he’d end up with the brother to the Dark Lord’s wand, was
//going to have an advantage.

// 593
//Professor McGonagall had simply said __how peculiar__ and left it at that,
//which had put Harry into a state of shock at the sheer, overwhelming
//__uncuriosity __of wizards and witches. In no __imaginable__ world
//would Harry have just went “Hm” and walked out of the shop without even
//__trying__ to come up with a hypothesis for what was going on.

// 594
//His left hand rose and touched his scar.

// 595
//What… __exactly…__

// 596
//“You’re a full wizard now,” said Professor McGonagall. “Congratulations.”

// 597
//Harry nodded.

// 598
//“And what do you think of the wizarding world?” said she.

// 599
//“It’s strange,” Harry said. “I ought to be thinking about everything I’ve seen
//of magic… everything that I now know is possible, and everything I now know to
//be a lie, and all the work left before me to understand it. And yet I find
//myself distracted by relative trivialities like,” Harry lowered his voice, “the
//whole Boy-Who-Lived thing.” There didn’t seem to be anyone nearby, but no point
//tempting fate.

// 600
//Professor McGonagall __ahemmed__. “Really? You don’t say.”

// 601
//Harry nodded. “Yes. It’s just… __odd.__ To find out that you were part of
//this grand story, the quest to defeat the great and terrible Dark Lord, and
//it’s already __done.__ Finished. Completely over with. Like you’re Frodo
//Baggins and you find out that your parents took you to Mount Doom and had you
//toss in the Ring when you were one year old and you don’t even remember it.”

// 602
//Professor McGonagall’s smile had grown somewhat fixed.

// 603
//“You know, if I were anyone else, anyone else at all, I’d probably be pretty
//worried about living up to that start. __Gosh, Harry, what have you done
//since you defeated the Dark Lord? Your own bookshop? That’s great! Say, did you
//know I named my child after you?__ But I have hopes that this will not prove to
//be a problem.” Harry sighed. “Still… it’s almost enough to make me wish that
//there were __some__ loose ends from the quest, just so I could say that I
//really, you know, __participated__ somehow.”

// 604
//“Oh?” said Professor McGonagall in an odd tone. “What did you have in mind?”

// 605
//“Well, for example, you mentioned that my parents were betrayed. Who betrayed
//them?”

// 606
//“Sirius Black,” the witch said, almost hissing the name. “He’s in Azkaban.
//Wizarding prison.”

// 607
//“How probable is it that Sirius Black will break out of prison and I’ll have to
//track him down and defeat him in some sort of spectacular duel, or better yet
//put a large bounty on his head and hide out in Australia while I wait for the
//results?”

// 608
//Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. “Not likely. No one has ever escaped from
//Azkaban, and I doubt that __he__ will be the first.”

// 609
//Harry was a bit sceptical of that “__no one__ has __ever__ escaped
//from Azkaban” line. Still, maybe with magic you could actually get close to a
//100// perfect prison, especially if you had a wand and they did not. The best
//way to get out would be to not go there in the first place.

// 610
//“All right then,” Harry said. “Sounds like it’s been nicely wrapped up.” He
//sighed, scrubbing his palm over his head. “Or maybe the Dark Lord didn’t
//__really__ die that night. Not completely. His spirit lingers, whispering
//to people in nightmares that bleed over into the waking world, searching for a
//way back into the living lands he swore to destroy, and now, in accordance with
//the ancient prophecy, he and I are locked in a deadly duel where the winner
//shall lose and the loser shall win -”

// 611
//Professor McGonagall’s head swivelled, and her eyes darted around, as though to
//search the street for listeners.

// 612
//“I’m __joking__, Professor,” Harry said with some annoyance. Sheesh, why
//did she always take everything so seriously -

// 613
//A slow sinking sensation began to dawn in the pit of Harry’s stomach.

// 614
//Professor McGonagall looked at Harry with a calm expression. A very,
//__very__ calm expression. Then a smile was put on. “Of course you are, Mr.
//Potter.”

// 615
//__Aw crap.__

// 616
//If Harry had needed to formalise the wordless inference that had just flashed
//into his mind, it would have come out something like, ‘If I estimate the
//probability of Professor McGonagall doing what I just saw as the result of
//carefully controlling herself, versus the probability distribution for all the
//things she would do __naturally__ if I made a bad joke, then this behavior
//is significant evidence for her hiding something.’

// 617
//But what Harry actually thought was, __Aw crap.__

// 618
//Harry turned his own head to scan the street. Nope, no one nearby. “He’s
//__not__ dead, is he,” Harry sighed.

// 619
//“Mr. Potter -”

// 620
//“The Dark Lord is alive. Of __course__ he’s alive. It was an __act__
//of utter __optimism__ for me to have even __dreamed__ otherwise. I
//__must__ have taken leave of my __senses__, I can’t __imagine__
//what I was __thinking.__ Just because __someone__ said that his body
//was found burned to a __crisp__, I can’t imagine why I would have thought
//he was __dead.__ __Clearly__ I have much left to learn about the art
//of proper __pessimism.__”

// 621
//“Mr. Potter -”

// 622
//“At least tell me there’s not really a prophecy…” Professor McGonagall was
//still giving him that bright, fixed smile. “Oh, you have __got__ to be
//kidding me.”

// 623
//“Mr. Potter, you shouldn’t go inventing things to worry about -”

// 624
//“Are you __actually__ going to tell me __that?__ Imagine my reaction
//later, when I find out that there was something to worry about after all.”

// 625
//Her fixed smile faltered.

// 626
//Harry’s shoulders slumped. “I have a whole world of magic to analyse. I do
//__not__ have time for this.”

// 627
//Then both of them shut up, as a man in flowing orange robes appeared on the
//street and slowly passed them by; Professor McGonagall’s eyes tracked him,
//unobtrusively. Harry’s mouth was moving as he chewed hard on his lip, and
//someone watching closely would have noticed a tiny spot of blood appear.

// 628
//When the orange-robed man had passed into the distance, Harry spoke again, in a
//low murmur. “Are you going to tell me the truth now, Professor McGonagall? And
//don’t bother trying to wave it off, I’m not stupid.”

// 629
//“You’re __eleven years old__, Mr. Potter!” she said in a harsh whisper.

// 630
//“And therefore subhuman. Sorry… for a moment there, I __forgot__.”

// 631
//“These are dreadful and important matters! They are __secret,__ Mr.
//Potter! It is a __catastrophe__ that you, still a child, know even this
//much! You must not tell __anyone,__ do you understand? Absolutely no one!”

// 632
//As sometimes happened when Harry got __sufficiently__ angry, his blood
//went cold, instead of hot, and a terrible dark clarity descended over his mind,
//mapping out possible tactics and assessing their consequences with iron
//realism.

// 633
//__Point out that you have a right to know: Failure. Eleven-year-old
//children do not have rights to know anything, in McGonagall’s eyes.__

// 634
//__Say that you will not be friends any more: Failure. She does not value
//your friendship sufficiently.__

// 635
//__Point out that you will be in danger if you do not know: Failure. Plans
//have already been made based on your ignorance. The __certain
//__inconvenience of rethinking will seem far more unpalatable than the
//mere __uncertain __prospect of your coming to harm.__

// 636
//__Justice and reason will both fail. You must either find something you
//have that she wants, or find something you can do which she fears…__

// 637
//Ah.

// 638
//“Well then, Professor,” Harry said in a low, icy tone, “it sounds like I have
//something you want. You can, if you like, tell me the truth, the __whole__
//truth, and in return I will keep your secrets. Or you can try to keep me
//ignorant so you can use me as a pawn, in which case I will owe you nothing.”

// 639
//McGonagall stopped short in the street. Her eyes blazed and her voice descended
//into an outright hiss. “How dare you!”

// 640
//“__How dare you!__” he whispered back at her.

// 641
//“You would __blackmail__ me?”

// 642
//Harry’s lips twisted. “I am __offering__ you a __favor.__ I am
//__giving__ you a chance to protect __your__ precious secret. If you
//refuse I will have __every__ natural motive to make inquiries elsewhere,
//not to spite you, but because I __have to know!__ Get past your pointless
//anger at a __child__ who you think ought to obey you, and you’ll realise
//that any sane adult would do the same! __Look at it from my perspective!
//How would you feel if it was YOU?__”

// 643
//Harry watched McGonagall, observed her harsh breathing. It occurred to him that
//it was time to ease off the pressure, let her simmer for a while. “You don’t
//have to decide right away,” Harry said in a more normal tone. “I’ll understand
//if you want time to think about my __offer__… but I’ll warn you of one
//thing,” Harry said, his voice going colder. “Don’t try that Obliviation spell
//on me. Some time ago I worked out a signal, and I have already sent that signal
//to myself. If I find that signal and I don’t __remember__ sending it…”
//Harry let his voice trail off significantly.

// 644
//McGonagall’s face was working as her expressions shifted. “I… wasn’t thinking
//of Obliviating you, Mr. Potter… but why would you have __invented__ such a
//signal if you didn’t know about -”

// 645
//“I thought of it while reading a Muggle science-fiction book, and said to
//myself, __well, just in case…__ And no, I won’t tell you the signal, I’m
//not dumb.”

// 646
//“I hadn’t planned to ask,” McGonagall said. She seemed to fold in on herself,
//and suddenly looked very old, and very tired. “This has been an exhausting day,
//Mr. Potter. Can we get your trunk, and send you home? I will trust you not to
//speak upon this matter until I have had time to think. Keep in mind that there
//are only two other people in the whole world who know about this matter, and
//they are Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and Professor Severus Snape.”

// 647
//So. New information; that was a peace offering. Harry nodded in acceptance, and
//turned his head to look forward, and started walking again, as his blood slowly
//began to warm over once more.

// 648
//“So now I’ve got to find some way to kill an immortal Dark Wizard,” Harry said,
//and sighed in frustration. “I really wish you had told me that __before__
//I started shopping.”

'''

// 649
//The trunk shop was more richly appointed than any other shop Harry had visited;
//the curtains were lush and delicately patterned, the floor and walls of stained
//and polished wood, and the trunks occupied places of honor on polished ivory
//platforms. The salesman was dressed in robes of finery only a cut below those
//of Lucius Malfoy, and spoke with exquisite, oily politeness to both Harry and
//Professor McGonagall.

// 650
//Harry had asked his questions, and had gravitated to a trunk of heavy-looking
//wood, not polished but warm and solid, carved with the pattern of a guardian
//dragon whose eyes shifted to look at anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed to be
//light, to shrink on command, to sprout small clawed tentacles from its bottom
//and squirm after its owner. A trunk with two drawers on each of four sides that
//each slid out to reveal compartments as deep as the whole trunk. A lid with
//four locks each of which would reveal a different space inside. And - this was
//the important part - a handle on the bottom which slid out a frame containing a
//staircase leading down into a small, lighted room that would hold, Harry
//estimated, around twelve bookcases.

// 651
//If they made luggages like this, Harry didn’t know why anyone bothered owning a
//house.

// 652
//One hundred and eight golden Galleons. That was the price of a good trunk,
//lightly used. At around fifty British pounds to the Galleon, that was enough to
//buy a second-hand car. It would be more expensive than everything else Harry
//had ever bought in his whole life all put together.

// 653
//Ninety-seven Galleons. That was how much was left in the bag of gold Harry had
//been allowed to take out of Gringotts.

// 654
//Professor McGonagall wore a look of chagrin upon her face. After a long day’s
//shopping she hadn’t needed to ask Harry how much gold was left in the bag,
//after the salesman quoted his price, which meant the Professor could do good
//mental arithmetic without pen and paper. Once again, Harry reminded himself
//that __scientifically illiterate__ was not at all the same thing as
//__stupid.__

// 655
//“I’m sorry, young man,” said Professor McGonagall. “This is entirely my fault.
//I would offer to take you back to Gringotts, but the bank will be closed for
//all but emergency services now.”

// 656
//Harry looked at her, wondering…

// 657
//“Well,” sighed Professor McGonagall, as she swung on one heel, “we may as well
//go, I suppose.”

// 658
//…she __hadn’t__ lost it completely when a child had dared defy her. She
//hadn’t been happy, but she had __thought__ instead of exploding in fury.
//It might have just been that there was an immortal Dark Lord to fight - that
//she had needed Harry’s goodwill. But most adults wouldn’t have been capable of
//thinking even that much; wouldn’t consider __future consequences__ at all,
//if someone lower in status had refused to obey them…____

// 659
//____

// 660
//“Professor?” Harry said.

// 661
//The witch turned back and looked at him.

// 662
//Harry took a deep breath. He needed to be a little angry for what he wanted to
//try now, there was no way he’d have the courage to do it otherwise. __She
//didn’t listen to me,__ he thought to himself, __I would have taken more
//gold but she didn’t want to listen…__ Focusing his entire world on McGonagall
//and the need to bend this conversation to his will, he spoke.

// 663
//“Professor, you thought one hundred Galleons would be more than enough for a
//trunk. That’s why you didn’t bother warning me before it went down to
//ninety-seven. Which is just the sort of thing the research studies show -
//that’s what happens when people think they’re leaving themselves a
//__little __error margin. They’re not pessimistic enough. If it’d been up
//to me, I’d have taken __two hundred__ Galleons just to be sure. There was
//plenty of money in that vault, and I could have put back any extra later. But I
//thought you wouldn’t let me do it. I thought you’d be angry at me just for
//asking. Was I wrong?”

// 664
//“I suppose I must confess that you are right,” said Professor McGonagall. “But,
//young man -”

// 665
//“That sort of thing is the reason why I have trouble trusting adults.” Somehow
//Harry kept his voice steady. “Because they get angry if you even __try__
//to reason with them. To them it’s defiance and insolence and a challenge to
//their higher tribal status. If you try to talk to them they get __angry.__
//So if I had anything __really ____important__ to do, I wouldn’t be
//able to trust you. Even if you listened with deep concern to whatever I said -
//because that’s also part of the __role__ of someone playing a concerned
//adult - you’d never change your actions, you wouldn’t actually behave
//differently, because of anything I said.”

// 666
//The salesman was watching them both with unabashed fascination.

// 667
//“I can understand your point of view,” Professor McGonagall said eventually.
//“If I sometimes seem too strict, please remember that I have served as Head of
//Gryffindor House for what feels like several thousand years.”

// 668
//Harry nodded and continued. “So - suppose I had a way to get more Galleons from
//my vault __without__ us going back to Gringotts, but it involved me
//violating the role of an obedient child. Would I be able to trust you with
//that, even though you’d have to step outside your own role as Professor
//McGonagall to take advantage of it?”

// 669
//“__What?__” said Professor McGonagall.

// 670
//“To put it another way, if I could make today have happened differently, so
//that we __didn’t__ take too little money with us, would that be all right
//even though it would involve a child being insolent to an adult in retrospect?”

// 671
//“I… suppose…” the witch said, looking quite puzzled.

// 672
//Harry took out the mokeskin pouch, and said, “Eleven Galleons originally from
//my family vault.”

// 673
//And there was gold in Harry’s hand.

// 674
//For a moment Professor McGonagall’s mouth gaped wide, then her jaw snapped shut
//and her eyes narrowed and the witch bit out, “__Where__ did you get that
//-”

// 675
//“From my family vault, like I said.”

// 676
//“__How?__”

// 677
//“Magic.”

// 678
//“That’s hardly an answer!” snapped Professor McGonagall, and then stopped,
//blinking.

// 679
//“No, it isn’t, is it? I __ought__ to claim that it’s because I
//experimentally discovered the true secrets of how the pouch works and that it
//can actually retrieve objects from anywhere, not just its own inside, if you
//phrase the request correctly. But actually it’s from when I fell into that pile
//of gold before and I shoved some Galleons into my pocket. Anyone who
//understands pessimism knows that money is something you might need quickly and
//without much warning. So now are you angry at me for defying your authority? Or
//glad that we succeeded in our important mission?”

// 680
//The salesman’s eyes were wide like saucers.

// 681
//And the tall witch stood there, silent.

// 682
//“Discipline at Hogwarts __must__ be enforced,” she said after almost a
//full minute. “For the sake of __all__ the students. And that __must__
//include courtesy and obedience from you to __all__ professors.”

// 683
//“I understand, Professor McGonagall.”

// 684
//“Good. Now let us buy that trunk and go home.”

// 685
//Harry felt like throwing up, or cheering, or fainting, or __something__.
//That was the first time his careful reasoning had ever worked on
//__anyone__. Maybe because it was also the first time he had something
//really serious that an adult needed from him, but still -

// 686
//Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.

// 687
//Harry bowed, and gave the bag of gold and the extra eleven Galleons into
//McGonagall’s hands. “Thank you very much, Professor. Can you finish up the
//purchase for me? I’ve got to visit the lavatory.”

// 688
//The salesman, unctuous once more, pointed toward a door set into the wall with
//a gold-handled knob. As Harry started to walk away, he heard the salesman ask
//in his oily voice, “May I inquire as to who that was, Madam McGonagall? I take
//it he is Slytherin - third-year, perhaps? - and from a prominent family, but I
//did not recognise -”

// 689
//The slam of the lavatory door cut off his words, and after Harry had identified
//the lock and pressed it into place, he grabbed the magical self-cleaning towel
//and, with shaky hands, wiped moisture off his forehead. Harry’s entire body was
//sheathed in sweat which had soaked clear through his Muggle clothing, though at
//least it didn’t show through the robes.

'''

// 690
//The sun was setting and it was very late indeed, by the time they stood again
//in the courtyard of the Leaky Cauldron, the silent leaf-dusted interface
//between magical Britain’s Diagon Alley and the entire Muggle world. (That was
//one __awfully__ decoupled economy…) Harry was to go to a phone box and
//call his father, once he was on the other side. He didn’t need to worry about
//his luggage being stolen, apparently. His trunk had the status of a major
//magical item, something that most Muggles wouldn’t notice; that was part of
//what you could get in the wizarding world, if you were willing to pay the price
//of a secondhand car.

// 691
//“So here we part ways, for a time,” Professor McGonagall said. She shook her
//head in wonderment. “This has been the strangest day of my life for… many a
//year. Since the day I learned that a child had defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder
//now, looking back, if that was the last reasonable day of the world.”

// 692
//Oh, like __she__ had anything to complain about. __You think your
//day ____was surreal? Try mine.__

// 693
//“I was very impressed with you today,” Harry said to her. “I should have
//remembered to compliment you out loud, I was awarding you points in my head and
//everything.”

// 694
//“Thank you, Mr. Potter,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you had already been
//sorted into a House I would have deducted so many points that your
//grandchildren would still be losing the House Cup.”

// 695
//“Thank __you__, Professor.” It was probably too early to call her Minnie.

// 696
//This woman might well be the sanest adult Harry had ever met, despite her lack
//of scientific background. Harry was even considering offering her the
//number-two position in whatever group he formed to fight the Dark Lord, though
//he wasn’t silly enough to say that out loud. __Now what would be a good
//name for that…? The Death Eater Eaters?__

// 697
//“I’ll see you again soon, when school starts,” Professor McGonagall said. “And,
//Mr. Potter, about your wand -”

// 698
//“I know what you’re going to ask,” Harry said. He took out his precious wand
//and, with a deep twinge of inner pain, flipped it over in his hand, presenting
//her with the handle. “Take it. I hadn’t planned to do anything, not a single
//thing, but I don’t want you to have nightmares about me blowing up my house.”

// 699
//Professor McGonagall shook her head rapidly. “Oh no, Mr. Potter! That isn’t
//done. I only meant to warn you not to __use__ your wand at home, since the
//Ministry can detect underage magic and it is prohibited without supervision.”

// 700
//“Ah,” Harry said. “That sounds like a very sensible rule. I’m glad to see the
//wizarding world takes that sort of thing seriously.”

// 701
//Professor McGonagall peered hard at him. “You really mean that.”

// 702
//“Yes,” Harry said. “I get it. Magic is dangerous and the rules are there for
//good reasons. Certain other matters are also dangerous. I get that too.
//Remember that I am not stupid.”

// 703
//“I am unlikely ever to forget it. Thank you, Harry, that does make me feel
//better about entrusting you with certain things. Goodbye for now.”

// 704
//Harry turned to go, into the Leaky Cauldron and out towards the Muggle world.

// 705
//As his hand touched the back door’s handle, he heard a last whisper from behind
//him.

// 706
//“Hermione Granger.”

// 707
//“What?” Harry said, his hand still on the door.

// 708
//“Look for a first-year girl named Hermione Granger on the train to Hogwarts.”

// 709
//“Who is she?”

// 710
//There was no answer, and when Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall was
//gone.

'''

// 711
//__Aftermath:__

// 712
//Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward over his desk. His twinkling eyes
//peered out at Minerva. “So, my dear, how did you find Harry?”

// 713
//Minerva opened her mouth. Then she closed her mouth. Then she opened her mouth
//again. No words came out.

// 714
//“I see,” Albus said gravely. “Thank you for your report, Minerva. You may go.”
